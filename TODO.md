# TODO

- Look at documentation in lifepillar/vim-colortemplate
  There is some good stuff about making sure colorschemes don't mess
  anything up.

- See if we can get changes merged with upstream.

- See if any improvements can be made to neovim support
  * https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/issues/180
  * maybe specifically the neovim terminal?
