# TODO

- Look into using more colors for spelling.
- Don't need htmlBold and markdownBold etc. because already done by syntax
  files.
- The following highlight groups:
  * PmenuSbar
  * PmenuThumb
  * Menu
  * Scrollbar
  * Tooltip
  * debugPC
  * debugBreakpoint
  * NormalNC
  * NormalFloat
  * TermCursor
  * TermCursorNC

- Look at documentation in lifepillar/vim-colortemplate
  There is some good stuff about making sure colorschemes don't mess
  anything up.

- See if any improvements can be made to neovim support
  * https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/issues/180
  * maybe specifically the neovim terminal?
